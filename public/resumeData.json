We used many large data sets (Big Data) to show the correlations of how education funding systems can affect the success of students. Using this data we presented some novel solutions about funding that can benefit the success of students using the integrative thinking method and applying ideas from the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goal 4 in order to achieve “Equity in Education”. Recently, our project abstraction was published in the 2020-2021 STEM Fellowship Scientific Journal. Check out my GitHub for more information about this project."
